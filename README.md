## How to Play

   Enter a valid five-letter word and submit your guess.

2. **Feedback:**

   - Letters in the correct position are highlighted in green.
   - Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position are highlighted in yellow.
   - Letters not in the word are shown in gray.

3. **Attempts:**  
   You have six tries to guess the correct word.

4. **Hints:**  
   Use up to two hints per game to help you solve the puzzle.

5. **Leaderboard:**  
   Compete with other players and see your ranking on the leaderboard.

6. **Game History:**  
   Track your wins and losses in your personal game history.

## Features
